# CPPsinglylinkedlist
C++ code for singly linked list with functions to add new nodes at the beginning , add new nodes at the end, delete first node, delete last node and display nodes.

ALGORITHM:

1. Start

2. Create a class node with its attributes as data(integer) and a pointer(eg: next).

3. Using constructor initialize these attributes to 0 and null pointer.

4. Create a class (eg: singlylinkedlist) with a pointer(eg: head) as its attribute.

5. Using constructor initialize the pointer to null.

6. Create a function to add a node at the beginning with and integer argument. This function will have a pointer pointing to a new node and its data would be the argument value while its next will be at head.

7. Create function to add a node at the end.

8. Create function to delete the first node.

9. Create function to delete last node.

10. Create function to display nodes using loops.

11. In main function, create class object for singlylinkedlist and call functions as required.

12. End.
